This is just a quick demo to show how easy it is to “clone” a popular trusted site for the purpose of tricking users into putting in their information. This is not a “how to build a phishing site” tutorial. I show how to structure the HTML creating a form for the user to put in their data. Style is with some CSS. And build a simple Php mailer that will email the users input to you when they hit login and then direct them to the site the thought they were on the whole time.

I won’t show you how to make it look like the actual site in the address bar or copyright footers or anything like that. I also won’t respond to any questions asking me how to do that. 

Don’t do anything dumb with this info. I won’t be held responsible if you use this for anything illegal.
